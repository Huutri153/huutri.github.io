		<p>I was born in Viet Nam, specifically in Ben Tre city, which is most famous for coconuts. There’s not much to see, only the mangrove forests, dunes beach, the canals, small islands and several areas for planting coconut trees. I grew up exploring most of the city’s fascinating scenery and learned a thing or two making interesting products from coconut trees components, then moved to Ho Chi Minh City at the age of 4 to start my educational journey from there. Spending 12 years of studying, I’ve now become a high school graduate. Beside my native language and English, I can also speak Spanish roughly.</p>
		<p>I’m a mellow and chill type of person. I do like playing video games or sports, especially badminton, but not very often. One of my main hobbies is listening to music. I’m really into any type of slow music or mellow pop, acoustic, classical music or even piano ballads. That’s why I can play guitar and I want to be able to play other instruments in the future. I can also draw as well. Sometimes I find myself immersed in sketching whenever I come across something that’s visually pleasing. It’s a fun way for me to keep myself sane after a long day of work. Fun fact about me? I used to learn martial art and attended a tournament once. The funny thing is I actually I won the tournament, at least that’s what my friend told me due to the disqualification of other opponents, even though I ran away scared.  </p>

	<div class="itinterest">
		<p>I’ve always thought of Information Technology as an innovative way of how our lives work nowadays. What I find fascinating about Information Technology is its evolution, variety and capability. Because it’s always in high demand, you can find so many jobs that’s IT-related nowadays. Databases, computer software, mobile data, servers, even things we see every day like websites, apps,...each part plays a role for the larger, interconnected informational ecosystem. Hence there are many different fields that one can be indulged in. I’m actually leaning towards programming. The thought of how games, websites, and software are created just from lines and lines of code really piques my interest. The possibilities are endless within your creativity and imagination. It all started when I discovered a youtuber named ThinMatrix. Watching his videos about game developing, I saw how coding works for the first time and completely amazed by it, but never got the time to delve into it due to abundant amount of school works. I got to learn coding in Pascal when I was at high school and surprisingly was the one who was always willing to study. And for that reason, I’ve probably known a thing or two about programming before came here.</p>
		<p>At the age of 16, I started studying for IELTS. Being taught English since very young, I advanced a lot more quickly than other peer students and later realized that I want to study in an international environment. That was when RMIT came into mind. I was fully aware of RMIT when it was in its early build, and always astounded by its facilities, its teaching programs. Many people think that RMIT is not the best for me to pursue my IT interest, but I mainly focus on what I will learn rather than what well-paid jobs I will get in the future.</p>
		<p>I’m coming to RMIT with a main goal which is to develop my technical skills, learn from basic to advanced about programming and computer science. Not only that, I also wish to improve some of my soft skills as well. Things like communication, working as a team, ability to handle tasks under pressure, or even work independently,…are very crucial for my future career.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="idealjob">
		<p>There’s one job I think would suit me the best. And that is being a game developer.</p>
		<img class="job" src="images/job1.PNG">
		<p>Game developers basically design and create different video games for mobile devices, computers and consoles. They are often involved in many aspects in the process of creating games such as story concept, visual arts, audio, coding and programming,…For me, the most appealing part of this particular job is that there are opportunities for game developers to work on their own instead of working full-time at the office. There are some awesome games out there such as Undertale, Stardew Valley,… they are created and developed by only one person. That really inspires me to express my creativity and turn my ideas into form of interactive entertainment.</p>
		<p>Like many IT jobs, game developers need to have technical ability. Particularly, they have to get accustomed to a variety of programming languages. A good developer always know There are also a lot of communication and team working skills involved to cooperate with other developers, as well as the capability to work independently when you focus on your own project. Not only that, you need to be enthusiastic for the industry and willing to keep learning, keep evolving as a developer. Sometimes, it is possible for people to become a developer without having any degree, as long as they are experienced, but most of the people in the game industry are graduated. A degree in computer science, software engineering or any related subject, with working experience and a portfolio as a good jumping off point, you can also be ready to get in the industry. In addition, the ability to use programming languages such as C#, C++, Java… is one of the main requirements. As a game also needs visual arts, music, sound effects, etc…you may need experience in some other program like audio, 2D or 3D animation.</p>
		<p>As for me, I still have a long way to go before I can consider myself a game developer. I’m a pretty introverted person myself, hence I don’t know how or probably can’t get along well with others, but I can work well in a team because I always perform my part in a serious way whenever I get assigned on something. I don’t know if that’s actually helpful but I think I can be a decent teammate, I can join team discussion and always willing to learn and improve myself to resolve whenever there’s a mishap. I’ve just graduated from high school not too long ago so I’m yet to have any degree. Regarding technical experience, I only know a few things about some simple programming languages like Pascal and Python. I do like drawing and making art, maybe I can use that to my advantage.</p>
		<p>Considering where I’m standing now, like I said, I still have a long way to go before achieving all I need to become a developer. The main thing I have to improve is my charisma skills. I will try to take some communication classes in the future, or at least practice talking in front of a mirror to slowly build up those skills day by day. Working independently is something I can definitely do, but a lot of things just cannot be accomplished without a team effort. I just need to feel confident enough to cooperate well with other people and to know how to present my ideas in an appropriate way. As I just graduated from high school, I’ve got nothing to show, degree-wise. And that’s why I’m here studying Information Technology at RMIT. After finishing my first 3 introduction courses, I’m going to take on more computer science, programming as well as software engineering courses. Since right now I’m still having very vague knowledge about any coding, taking programming courses like Programming 1, Advanced Programming Techniques, Programming Using C++,… is going to be a good way for me to start getting used to many common programming languages like Java, C++. I also will take some art and 3D design courses to further expand my art interest and put it into good use in the future. When university is over, I will take a year or two for myself to improve those programming skills on my own, and learn some new programming languages. It is also going to be a perfect interval for me to build up my portfolio as well as my CV by creating some small projects before I decide to get a job.</p>

		<h3>Big Five Personalities Test Result</h3>
		<p>     </p>
		<p>     </p>
		<p>     </p>
		<p>     </p>
		<p>After taking these tests, I think that these results sum up everything about me in a perfect way. I always find it difficult for me to blend in a crowd, to make friends as easily as many others. That’s why I enjoy working on my own. Sometimes I just prefer to sit in a corner, and communicate with the surroundings through my vision. You will be surprised how amazing it would be if you could just relax and let everything around you take its course. I don’t talk much, but I do have a lot going on in my mind. Whenever I do something, or make any decision, I always think twice before doing anything. Taking things into account is thought to be a great trait, but it doesn’t make me handle my tasks in a decent and efficient way, because I always have a troubled mind. Being sensitive and completely paranoid sometimes lead me to a poor outcome, or even being fallen under other people’s opinions. When it comes to learning, I usually gain better understanding by looking at the examples or experience it myself rather by just listening to the lecturers.</p>
		<p>Every result of these tests plays an important role for my performance regarding teamwork. I don’t think of myself as a team leader, but I do think I can carry the team relatively well. During discussion, I don’t speak that often, but I’m always open to suggestions and ideas, and also willing to learn and improve myself on the go. Then again, communication is key, so that is something I have to work on in the future.</p>
		<p>Eventually when I form a team, I have to try my best to be as welcoming and accommodating as I can. It would also be ideal for me to join a group of like-minded people, I can be more encouraged to open up about me and my ideas if I know that I work with people who share the same view and opinions. I need to decisive when it comes to plan-making as well. I might not be cut out to be a team leader, but at some point, there comes a time when my opinion really matters.</p>

		<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
		<p>For my big project in the future, I decided that I would make a 2D RPG, simulation as well as story-driven game using Unity. It is a chill pixelated indie game that involves a little bit of puzzle solving. The main idea of what the game will be is that you’ll be playing as a dog which is either a stray one or one in a shelter waiting to be rescued or adopted by potential owners. There is actually no main goal for this game, but the point is you’ll eventually grow old and try to live a most fulfill life with your owner, and discover some secrets about said owner’s story on the way.</p>
		<h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
		<p>One of the main reasons why I want to make this project a possibility is that I really have an unconditional love for dogs. As you may know, animal abuse is a very concerning matter. Especially in Asia, life for millions of dogs as well as cats are in danger. Some are abandoned, left to fend for themselves after being dumped by cruel owners. It’s estimated that in China alone, 10 million dogs and 4 million cats are even slaughtered for their meat each year. In the US, there’s one survey shows that 71 percent of domestic violence victims reported that their abusers also targeted pets as well. Seeing pets get treated with such cruelty like that always gets me riled up. What makes me think this project is important is that it is going to be a great way to show people how much attention and love dog always need and that their owners mean the world to them.</p>
		<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
		<p>To begin with, one of the main features in the project is the “Create your dog” section, where you’ll be able to customize your canine character. First you choose any of the dog breeds varied from big to small dogs that you prefer, maybe you would like a husky, a border collie, golden retriever, labradoodle or even a Chihuahua, the choice is all yours. And then you can modify it by changing your dog’s head, muzzle, ears or tail style, you just need to let your creative mind flow and create a dog of own dream.</p>
		<p>Once the customization is complete, there will be a UI system where you can choose to start your journey on the street or at the shelter. If you want to play in a rough and a challenging way, you can choose to start as a stray dog. Being out in the street, you have to try to survive and eventually find someone that’s perfect for you, build up relationship with that person before they decide to bring you into their life. But if that’s not what you prefer, you can start in a shelter and wait for someone to adopt.</p>
		<p>If you decide to be a stray dog, you will be set in a free-roam region, which is either in a city or in a small town, surrounded by human and other dog NPCs. There will be buildings, streets, alleyway, basically a lot of nook and cranny for you to explore, mark your territory and stay out for the night. You can befriend another dog and potentially form a pack together, beg, perform to earn some treats or you can be as diabolical as you want and steal some food from unsuspecting humans. When they eventually catch you in action, let the chasing game begin. You can sprint for short period of time to make your way out of the chasers sight. As you get tired from surviving on your own, it’s about time you found yourself a human companion for life.</p>
		<p>Every owner will have their own ways of life, different stories and daily routines. Each of them will also have a secret and background that they may or may not share it with you, or you have to discover it on your own. As a pet, you can interact with your owner, other people and many things in your surroundings. Based on different breeds, you acquire different traits and personalities and you’ll have different interactions. For instance, if you’re a husky who is incredibly energetic and prefer rough-housing more than anything else, you can ask your owner to go exercise or play with you all the time, or if you want to be super intelligent like a border collie, you can easily understand your owner and need to train to follow commands. You can choose to give either good or bad interaction with your owners based on your relationship with them. You are able to pick up any items, carrying around and drop it as well. This gives you a change to give your owners something special to improve your relationship. The game will also have day and night cycle, every 1 second in real-time will be 1 minute period in game.</p>
		<h1>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
		<p>The main tool required is Unity. It’s one of the most popular cross-platform game engines out there. With its crossed platform support, the best thing is that we don’t need any additional tools to import and share the application between PC, web and mobile platforms. It has a lot of resources all over the web, ranging from simple beginner-friendly tutorials to more highly advances and complete tutorials, and a huge community forum for you to easily come to if you have any problems. Also the debugging and tweaking is amazingly easier with Unity game development because all the game variables are displayed during gameplay, which in turn allow the developers to debug the process in a pinch. As far as programming language goes, Unity mainly supports C# and requires for developers to have prior knowledge of programming. On the other hand, C# is an expressive and powerful programming language that is relatively easy to learn. Apart from those, there are also some software needed in terms of artistic design like Krita or Aseprite, which is useful for making pixel art and allow you to create your own texture and backgrounds, LMMS – a music creator software which allows you to create your own music and sound effects.</p>
		<h1>SKILLS REQUIRED</h1>
		<p>As how ambitious and over-achieving this project may seem, I need to have a strong and solid knowledge in programming and software design. That requires. Beyond coding experience, designing skills, such as character design, scenery and user interface design are also crucial since graphics and animation play a huge role in game development. Regarding the concept as mentioned above, I need to do a lot more research and gain an intimate understanding of cultural tastes and preferences. Not only that, I need to also keep myself updated on what is happening with competitors and the gaming world in general. Communication is always an essential part and it is sometimes overlooked by developers. You can never achieve anything on your own, sometimes having a team is all you need. It is important to share your visions and ideas to other project team members like visual artists, producers, music and sound effects specialists, and marketers. All of these requirements above take time, so I just need to be persistent and improve myself along the way. You cannot just wake up one day and become a game developer in a snap.</p>
		<h1>OUTCOME</h1>
		<p>Making a project like this might take up to a year, if not more. If I eventually succeed in making this project solid, this will be my way of using my own platform to entertain the players as well as sending my message. I want to show people that there are a lot more about a man’s best friend than meets the eye. It is important for us to raise the public awareness about spreading love to the animals in general and treat them the right way. Going through this project will help me improve my skills a lot and advance one step at a time even further into the industry.</p>
