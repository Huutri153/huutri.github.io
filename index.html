		<p>I was born in Viet Nam, specifically in Ben Tre city, which is most famous for coconuts. There’s not much to see, only the mangrove forests, dunes beach, the canals, small islands and several areas for planting coconut trees. I grew up exploring most of the city’s fascinating scenery and learned a thing or two making interesting products from coconut trees components, then moved to Ho Chi Minh City at the age of 4 to start my educational journey from there. Spending 12 years of studying, I’ve now become a high school graduate. Beside my native language and English, I can also speak Spanish roughly.</p>
		<p>I’m a mellow and chill type of person. I do like playing video games or sport, especially badminton, but not very often. One of my main hobbies is listening to music. I’m really into any type of slow music or mellow pop, acoustic, classical music or even piano ballads. That’s why I can play guitar and I want to be able to play other instruments in the future. Fun fact about me? I can draw. Sometimes I find myself immersed in sketching whenever I come across something that’s visually pleasing. It’s a fun way for me to keep myself sane after a long day of work</p>

		<p>I’ve always thought of Information Technology as an innovative way of how our lives work nowadays. What I find fascinating about Information Technology is its evolution, variety and capability. Because it’s always in high demand, you can find so many jobs that’s IT-related nowadays. Databases, computer software, mobile data, servers, even things we see everyday like websites, apps,...each part plays a role for the larger, interconnected informational ecosystem. Hence there are many different fields that one can be indulged in. I’m actually leaning towards programming. The thought of how games, websites, and software are created just from lines and lines of code really piques my interest. It all started when I discovered a youtuber named ThinMatrix. Watching his videos about game developing, I saw how coding works for the first time and completely amazed by it, but never got the time to delve into it due to abundant amount of school works. I got to learn coding in Pascal when I was at high school and surprisingly was the one who was always willing to study. And for that reason, I’ve probably known a thing or two about programming before came here.</p>
		<p>At the age of 16, I started studying for IELTS. Being taught English since very young, I advanced a lot more quickly than other peer students and later realized that I want to study in an international environment. That was when RMIT came into mind. I was fully aware of RMIT when it was in its early build, and always astounded by its facilities, its teaching programs. Many people think that RMIT is not the best for me to pursue my IT interest, but I mainly focus on what I will learn rather than what well-paid jobs I will get in the future.</p>
		<p>I’m coming to RMIT with a main goal which is to develop my technical skills, learn from basic to advanced about programming and computer science. Not only that, I also wish to improve some of my soft skills as well. Things like communication, working as a team, ability to handle tasks under pressure, or even work independently,…are very crucial for my future carrer.</p>

	<div class="idealjob">
		<p>There’s one job I think would suit me the best. And that is being a game developer.</p>
		<img class="job" src="images/job1.PNG">
		<p>Game developers basically design and create different video games for mobile devices, computers and consoles. They are often involved in many aspects in the process of creating games such as story concept, visual arts, audio, coding and programming,…For me, the most appealing part of this particular job is that there are opportunities for game developers to work on their own instead of working full-time at the office. There are some awesome games out there such as Undertale, Stardew Valley,… they are created and developed by only one person. That really inspires me to express my creativity and turn my ideas into form of interactive entertainment.</p>
		<p>Like many IT jobs, game developers need to have technical ability. Particularly, they have to get accustomed to a variety of programming languages. A good developer always know There are also a lot of communication and team working skills involved to cooperate with other developers, as well as the capability to work independently when you focus on your own project. Not only that, you need to be enthusiastic for the industry and willing to keep learning, keep evolving as a developer. Sometimes, it is possible for people to become a developer without having any degree, as long as they are experienced, but most of the people in the game industry are graduated. A degree in computer science, software engineering or any related subject, with working experience and a portfolio as a good jumping off point, you can also be ready to get in the industry. In addition, the ability to use programming languages such as C#, C++, Java… is one of the main requirements. As a game also needs visual arts, music, sound effect, ect…you may need experience in some other program like audio, 2D or 3D animation.</p>
		<p>As for me, I still have a long way to go before I can consider myself a game developer. I’m a pretty introverted person myself, hence I don’t know how or probably can’t get along well with others, but I can work well in a team because I always perform my part in a serious way whenever I get assigned on something. I don’t know if that’s actually helpful but I think I can be a decent teammate, I can join team discussion and always willing to learn and improve myself to resolve whenever there’s a mishap. I’ve just graduated from high school not too long ago so I’m yet to have any degree. Regarding technical experience, I only know e few things about some simple programming languages like Pascal and Python. I do like drawing and making art, maybe I can use that to my advantage.</p>
		<p>Considering where I’m standing now, like I said I still have long way to go before achieving all I need to become a developer. The main thing I have to improve is my charisma skills. I will try to take some communication class in the future, or at least practice talking in front a mirror to slowly build up those skills day by day. Working independently is something I can definitely do, but a lot of things just cannot be accomplished without a team effort. I just need to feel confident enough to cooperate well with other people and to know how to present my ideas in an appropriate way. As I just graduated from high school, I’ve got nothing to show, degree-wise. And that’s why I’m here studying Information Technology at RMIT. After finishing my first 3 introduction courses, I’m going to take on more computer science, programming as well as software engineering courses. Since right now I’m still having very vague knowledge about any coding, taking programming courses like Programming 1, Advanced Programming Techniques, Programming Using C++,… is going to be a good way for me to start getting used to many common programming languages like Java, C++. I also will take some art and 3D design courses to further expand my art interest and put it into good use in the future. When university is over, I will take a year or two for myself to improve those programming skills on my own, and learn some new programming languages. It is also going to be a perfect interval for me to build up my portfolio by creating some small projects before I decide to get a job.</p>
